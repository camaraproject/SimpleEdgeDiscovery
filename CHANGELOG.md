**Please be aware that the project will have frequent updates to the main branch. There are no compatibility guarantees associated with code in any branch, including main, until it has been released. For example, changes may be reverted before a release is published. For the best results, use the latest published release.**

The below sections record the changes for each API version in each release as follows:

* for an alpha release, the delta with respect to the previous release
* for the first release-candidate, all changes since the last public release
* for subsequent release-candidate(s), only the delta to the previous release-candidate
* for a public release, the consolidated changes since the previous public release

NOTE: SimpleEdgeDiscovery is part of the EdgeCloud API Sub Project, and was previously developed within the [EdgeCloud](https://github.com/camaraproject/EdgeCloud) repository. Two releases were made within EdgeCloud, v0.81 and r0.9.3-rc. These releases also include the other EdgeCloud APIs and materials, so the changelog below highlights only the changes related to SimpleEdgeDiscovery. Further information and links to the releases in EdgeCloud can be found below.
