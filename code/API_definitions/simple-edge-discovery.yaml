  # Find the closest Edge Cloud Zone
  ---
  # Summary

  The Simple Edge Discovery API returns the name of the closest operator Edge
  Cloud Zone to a particular user device.

  # Purpose
  Network operators may host multiple Edge Cloud Zones in a
  given territory. Connecting your application to a server on the closest
  Edge Cloud Zone means packets travel the shortest distance between
  endpoints, typically resulting in the lowest round-trip latency. Note, the
  physical (GPS) location of a user device is not a reliable way to determine
  the closest Edge Cloud Zone, due to the way operator networks are routed -
  so the operator will calculate the Edge Cloud Zone with the
  _shortest network path_to the network-attached device identified in the API
  request.

  Once you have the name of the closest Edge Cloud Zone to the user device,
  you may:

  * connect the application client on the user device to your application
  server instance on that Edge Cloud Zone. Note: the address of that server
  instance is not part of the API response, but should be known in advance.
  * or, if you have no instance on that Edge Cloud Zone, you may wish to
  deploy one there.

  Note: the provider of the Edge Cloud Zone may be an operator, or a cloud
  provider working in partnership with the operator.

  # Usage

  The API may be called either by an application client hosted on a device
  attached to the operator network (i.e. phone, tablet), or by a server.

  There is a single API endpoint: `/edge-cloud-zones?filter=closest`. To call
  this endpoint, the API consumer must first obtain a valid OAuth2 token from
  the token endpoint, and pass it as an `Authorization` header in the API
  request.

  # Identifying the device

  The API returns the closest Edge Cloud Zone to a given device, so that
  device needs to be identifiable by the network. This can be achieved either
  by passing a device identifier in the request header, or, from the
  three-legged access token where implemented by the operator.

  ## Passing a device identifier in the request header

  * If you call the API from a server, you must explicitly pass one or
  more device identifiers in the HTTP request header:
    * `IPv4-Address` or `IPv6-Address`. This is the public IP address of the
    user device: this
    can be obtained by an application hosted on that device calling a
    public IP address API (e.g. GET https://api.ipify.org?format=json)
    * If you provide an `IPv4-Address` or `IPv6-Address`: for certain
    operators you may be required to also provide a `Public-port` header.
    * `Phone-Number` . The international E.164 format (starting with country
    code), e.g. +4407123123456
    * `Network-Access-Identifier` (where available from the API host operator)

  * If you call the API from a device attached to the operator network, then
  you can attempt the request without passing device identifier(s) parameters
  in the request header. If that returns a 422 `MISSING_IDENTIFIER`
  error then retry the request but this time include a device identifier.

  NOTE1: the network operator might support only a subset of these options.
  The API invoker can provide multiple identifiers to be compatible across
  different network operators. In this case the identifiers MUST belong to the
  same device.

  NOTE2: for the Commonalities release v0.4, we are enforcing that the
  `networkAccessIdentifier` is only part of the schema for future-proofing, and
  CAMARA does not currently allow its use. After the CAMARA meta-release work
  is concluded and the relevant issues are resolved, its use will need to be
  explicitly documented in the guidelines.

  ### Example requests:

  Examples for all API clients:
  ```
    GET /edge-cloud-zones?filter=closest HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    Accept: application/json
    IPv4-Address: 84.125.93.10

    GET /edge-cloud-zones?filter=closest HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    Accept: application/json
    Phone-Number: +441234567890
  ```
  Example where the network operator requires the public port to be passed:
  ```
    GET /edge-cloud-zones?filter=closest HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    Accept: application/json
    IPv4-Address: 84.125.93.10
    Public-port: 1234
  ```

  Example where API client is on a network-attached device:
  ```
    GET /edge-cloud-zones?filter=closest HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    Accept: application/json
  ```

  ## Identifying the device from the access token

  This API requires the API consumer to identify a device as the subject of
  the API as follows:

  - When the API is invoked using a two-legged access token, the subject will be
  identified from the optional [`device` object | `phoneNumber` field](*), which
  therefore MUST be provided.
  - When a three-legged access token is used however, this optional identifier
  MUST NOT be provided, as the subject will be uniquely identified from the access
  token.

  This approach simplifies API usage for API consumers using a three-legged access
  token to invoke the API by relying on the information that is associated with the
  access token and was identified during the authentication process.

  ## Error handling:

  - If the subject cannot be identified from the access token and the optional `device`
  object is not included in the request, then the server will return an error with the
  `422 MISSING_IDENTIFIER` error code.

  - If the subject can be identified from the access token and the optional `device`
  object is also included in the request, then the server will return an error with the
  `422 UNNECESSARY_IDENTIFIER` error code. This will be the case even if the same device
  is identified by these two methods, as the server is unable to make this comparison.

  # Responses

  ## Success

  A JSON object is returned containing an array with a single member object.
  This contains identifiers for the closest Edge Cloud Zone. The HTTP status
  code will be`200 OK`. An example response:

  ```
  [
    {
      "edgeCloudZoneId": "4gt555-6457-7890-d4he-1dc79f44gb66",
      "edgeCloudZoneName": "example zone name",
      "edgeCloudProvider": "example zone provider"
    }
  ]
  ```
  * `edgeCloudZoneId` is a UUID for the Edge Cloud Zone.
  * `edgeCloudZoneName` is the common name of the closest Edge Cloud Zone to
  the user device.
  * `edgeCloudProvider` is the name of the operator or cloud provider of
  the Edge Cloud Zone.

  ## Errors

  If the authentication token is not valid, a `401 UNAUTHENTICATED` error is
  returned.

  If the mobile subscription parameters contain a formatting error, a `400
  INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned.

  If the mobile subscription cannot be identified from the provided
  parameters, a `404 NOT_FOUND` error is returned.

  Any more general service failures will result in an error in the `5xx`range
  with an explanation.

  # Notes for Simple Edge Discovery API publishers

  If an `IPv4-Address` or `IPv6-Address` header parameter is provided then the
  operator should
  assume the request is coming from a developer's server rather than a device
  attached to the network. In which case the developer server is expected to
  have been provided with the device public IP address (e.g. by the
  application client on that device signalling it back to the server).

  If neither an `IPv4-Address`/`IPv6-Address` parameter, nor any other device
  identifier,  is
  provided in the API request header then the operator should assume the
  request is from a device attached to their network, and attempt to use the
  public IP source address to determine which packet gateway issued it (and
  hence the closest edge to that gateway).

  If no `IPv4-Address`/`IPv6-Address` header parameter is provided, but another
  device
  identifier(s) is provided, then the operator should assume the request is
  coming from a device attached to their network and should make use of one
  or both of the public IP source address (from the IP packet header) and the
  device identifier(s) provided in the HTTPS request header.

  Should your implementation require the `Port` value to be passed in addition
  to the `IP-Address`, please make that explicit in the documentation, and
  utilise the `GENERIC_400_MISSING_PORT` error if the `Port` header is omitted.

  # Authorization and authentication

  The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details on how a
  client requests an access token. Please refer to Identify and Consent
  Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/)
  for the released version of the Profile.

  Which specific authorization flows are to be used will be determined during
  onboarding process, happening between the API Client and the Telco Operator
  exposing the API, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing
  the API, while also being subject to the prevailing legal framework
  dictated by local legislation.

  It is important to remark that in cases where personal user data is
  processed by the API, and users can exercise their rights through
  mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of 3-legged access tokens
  becomes mandatory. This measure ensures that the API remains in strict
  compliance with user privacy preferences and regulatory obligations,
  upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric data control.
