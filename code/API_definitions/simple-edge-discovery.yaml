    # Find the closest Edge Cloud Zone
    ---
    # Summary

    The Simple Edge Discovery API returns the name of the closest operator Edge
    Cloud Zone to a particular user device.

    # Purpose
    Network operators may host multiple Edge Cloud Zones in a
    given territory. Connecting your application to a server on the closest
    Edge Cloud Zone means packets travel the shortest distance between
    endpoints, typically resulting in the lowest round-trip latency. Note, the
    physical (GPS) location of a user device is not a reliable way to determine
    the closest Edge Cloud Zone, due to the way operator networks are routed -
    so the operator will calculate the Edge Cloud Zone with the
    _shortest network path_to the network-attached device identified in the API
    request.

    Once you have the name of the closest Edge Cloud Zone to the user device,
    you may:

    * connect the application client on the user device to your application
    server instance on that Edge Cloud Zone. Note: the IP address of that
    application server instance is not part of the API response, so you will need
    to map the edge cloud zone name to the server endpoint IP address you received
    when you deployed the server via the cloud provider's API.
    * or, if you have no instance on that Edge Cloud Zone, you may wish to
    deploy one there using the cloud provider's APIs.

    Note: the provider of the Edge Cloud Zone may be an operator, or a cloud
    provider working in partnership with the operator.

    # Usage

    The API may be called either by an application client hosted on a device
    attached to the operator network (i.e. phone, tablet), or by a server.

    There is a single API endpoint: `/retrieve-closest-edge-cloud-zone`.

    To call this endpoint, the API consumer must first obtain a valid OAuth2 token
    from the token endpoint, and pass it as an `Authorization` header in the API
    request.

    # Identifying the device

    The API returns the closest Edge Cloud Zone to a given device, so that
    device needs to be identifiable by the network. This can be achieved either
    by passing one or more device identifiers in the request, or, from the
    three-legged access token where implemented by the operator.

    ## Passing device identifier(s) in the request
    At least one of the following device identifiers must be provided, unless
    using a 3-legged access toekn (see next section):
     - Phone number (i.e. MSISDN)
     - Network Access Identifier assigned by the mobile network operator for the device
     - IPv6 address
     - IPv4 address


    NOTE1: the network operator might support only a subset of these options.
    The API invoker can provide multiple identifiers to be compatible across
    different network operators. In this case the identifiers MUST belong to the
    same device.

    NOTE2: for this Commonalities release,  we are enforcing that the
    `networkAccessIdentifier` is only part of the schema for future-proofing, and
    CAMARA does not currently allow its use. After the CAMARA meta-release work
    is concluded and the relevant issues are resolved, its use will need to be
    explicitly documented in the guidelines.


    ## Identifying the device from the access token

    This API requires the API consumer to identify a device as the subject of
    the API as follows:

    - When the API is invoked using a two-legged access token, the subject will be
    identified from the optional `device` object, which therefore MUST be provided.
    - When a three-legged access token is used however, this optional identifier
    MUST NOT be provided, as the subject will be uniquely identified from the access
    token.

    This approach simplifies API usage for API consumers using a three-legged access
    token to invoke the API by relying on the information that is associated with the
    access token and was identified during the authentication process.

    ## Error handling:

    - If the subject cannot be identified from the access token and the optional `device`
    object is not included in the request, then the server will return an error with the
    `422 MISSING_IDENTIFIER` error code.

    - If the subject can be identified from the access token and the optional `device`
    object is also included in the request, then the server will return an error with the
    `422 UNNECESSARY_IDENTIFIER` error code. This will be the case even if the same device
    is identified by these two methods, as the server is unable to make this comparison.

    # Responses

    ## Success

    A JSON object is returned containing an array with a single member object.
    This contains identifiers for the closest Edge Cloud Zone. The HTTP status
    code will be`200 OK`. An example response:

    ```
    [
      {
        "edgeCloudZoneId": "4gt555-6457-7890-d4he-1dc79f44gb66",
        "edgeCloudZoneName": "example zone name",
        "edgeCloudProvider": "example zone provider"
      }
    ]
    ```
    * `edgeCloudZoneId` is a UUID for the Edge Cloud Zone.
    * `edgeCloudZoneName` is the common name of the closest Edge Cloud Zone to
    the user device.
    * `edgeCloudProvider` is the name of the operator or cloud provider of
    the Edge Cloud Zone.

    ## Errors

    If the authentication token is not valid, a `401 UNAUTHENTICATED` error is
    returned.

    If the mobile subscription parameters contain a formatting error, a `400
    INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned.

    If the mobile subscription cannot be identified from the provided
    parameters, a `404 NOT_FOUND` error is returned.

    Any more general service failures will result in an error in the `5xx`range
    with an explanation.

    ### Additional CAMARA error responses
    The list of error codes in this API specification is not exhaustive. Therefore
    the API specification may not document some non-mandatory error statuses as
    indicated in `CAMARA API Design Guidelines`.

    Please refer to the `CAMARA_common.yaml` of the Commonalities Release associated
    to this API version for a complete list of error responses.

    As a specific rule, error `501 - NOT_IMPLEMENTED` can be only a possible error
    response if it is explicitly documented in the API.

    # Notes for Simple Edge Discovery API publishers

    Should your implementation require the `Port` value to be passed in addition
    to the `IP-Address`, please make that explicit in the documentation, and
    utilise the `GENERIC_400_MISSING_PORT` error if the `Port` header is omitted.

    # Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details of how
    an API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to Identity and Consent
    Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/)
    for the released version of the profile.

    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during the
    onboarding process, happening between the provider of the application consuming
    the API and the operator's API exposure platform, taking into account the
    declared purpose for accessing the API, whilst also being subject to the
    prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    In cases where personal data is processed by the API and users can exercise
    their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of
    three-legged access tokens is mandatory. This ensures that the API remains
    in compliance with privacy regulations, upholding the principles of
    transparency and user-centric privacy-by-design.

        If the allocated and observed IP addresses are the same (i.e. NAT is not in use) then  the same address should be specified for both publicAddress and privateAddress.

        If NAT64 is in use, the device should be identified by its publicAddress and publicPort, or separately by its allocated IPv6 address (field ipv6Address of the Device object)

        In all cases, publicAddress must be specified, along with at least one of either privateAddress or publicPort, dependent upon which is known. In general, mobile devices cannot be identified by their public IPv4 address alone.
